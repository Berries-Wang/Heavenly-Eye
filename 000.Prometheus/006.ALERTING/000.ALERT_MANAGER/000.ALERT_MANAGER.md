# ALERTMANAGER 
The Alertmanager handles alerts sent by client applications such as the Prometheus server. It takes care of deduplicating, grouping, and routing them to the correct receiver integration such as email, PagerDuty, or OpsGenie. It also takes care of silencing and inhibition of alerts.(The Alertmanager handles alerts sent by client applications such as the Prometheus server.

## Grouping
Grouping categorizes alerts of similar nature into a single notification. This is especially useful during larger outages when many systems fail at once and hundreds to thousands of alerts may be firing simultaneously.(分组将性质相似的警报分类为单个通知。当许多系统同时发生故障并且可能同时触发数百到数千个警报时，这在较大的中断期间特别有用。)

### 举例
Example: Dozens or hundreds of instances of a service are running in your cluster when a network partition occurs. Half of your service instances can no longer reach the database. Alerting rules in Prometheus were configured to send an alert for each service instance if it cannot communicate with the database. As a result hundreds of alerts are sent to Alertmanager.（示例:当网络分区发生时，集群中正在运行数十或数百个服务实例。一半的服务实例不能再访问数据库。Prometheus中的警报规则被配置为在每个服务实例无法与数据库通信时向其发送警报。因此，数百个警报被发送到Alertmanager。）

As a user, one only wants to get a single page while still being able to see exactly which service instances were affected. Thus one can configure Alertmanager to group alerts by their cluster and alertname so it sends a single compact notification.（作为用户，人们只希望获得一个页面，同时仍然能够准确地看到哪些服务实例受到了影响。因此，可以将Alertmanager配置为按集群和alertname对警报进行分组，从而发送单个紧凑通知。）

Grouping of alerts, timing for the grouped notifications, and the receivers of those notifications are configured by a routing tree in the configuration file.（警报分组、分组通知的定时以及这些通知的接收者由配置文件中的路由树进行配置。）

## Inhibition
Inhibition is a concept of suppressing notifications for certain alerts if certain other alerts are already firing.（抑制是一个概念，如果某些警报已经触发，则抑制某些警报的通知。）

Example: An alert is firing that informs that an entire cluster is not reachable. Alertmanager can be configured to mute all other alerts concerning this cluster if that particular alert is firing. This prevents notifications for hundreds or thousands of firing alerts that are unrelated to the actual issue.（示例:正在触发警报，通知整个集群不可访问。可以将Alertmanager配置为在触发特定警报时静音与该集群相关的所有其他警报。这可以防止数百或数千个与实际问题无关的警报发出通知。）

Inhibitions are configured through the Alertmanager's configuration file.（抑制是通过Alertmanager的配置文件配置的。）

## Silences
Silences are a straightforward way to simply mute alerts for a given time. A silence is configured based on matchers, just like the routing tree. Incoming alerts are checked whether they match all the equality or regular expression matchers of an active silence. If they do, no notifications will be sent out for that alert.(静默是一种简单的方法，可以在给定时间内将警报静音。静默是基于匹配器配置的，就像路由树一样。检查传入警报是否与活动静默的所有相等或正则表达式匹配器匹配。如果他们这样做，则不会为该警报发送通知。)

Silences are configured in the web interface of the Alertmanager.(静默是在Alertmanager的web页面配置的)

## Client behavior
The Alertmanager has special requirements for behavior of its client. Those are only relevant for advanced use cases where Prometheus is not used to send alerts.(Alertmanager对其客户端的行为有特殊的要求。这些仅与不使用Prometheus发送警报的高级用例相关。)

## High Availability
Alertmanager supports configuration to create a cluster for high availability.  This can be configured using the --cluster-* flags.(Alertmanager支持通过配置创建集群来实现高可用性。这可以使用——cluster-*标志进行配置。)

It's important not to load balance traffic between Prometheus and its Alertmanagers, but instead, point Prometheus to a list of all Alertmanagers.(重要的是，不要在Prometheus和它的alertmanager之间对流量进行负载平衡，而是将Prometheus指向所有alertmanager的列表。)
