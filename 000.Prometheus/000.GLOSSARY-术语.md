# GLOSSARY-术语
|术语名称|含义|备注|
|---|---|---|
|Alert|An alert is the outcome of an alerting rule in Prometheus that is actively firing. Alerts are sent from Prometheus to the Alertmanager.(警报(alert)是普罗米修斯程序中主动触发警报规则的结果。Prometheus向Alertmanager发送告警。)||
|Alertmanager|The Alertmanager takes in alerts, aggregates them into groups, de-duplicates, applies silences, throttles, and then sends out notifications to email, Pagerduty, Slack etc.(Alertmanager接收警报，将它们聚合到组中，去重复，应用静音，限制，然后将通知发送到电子邮件，Pagerduty, Slack等。)||
|Bridge|A bridge is a component that takes samples from a client library and exposes them to a non-Prometheus monitoring system. For example, the Python, Go, and Java clients can export metrics to Graphite.(bridge是一个组件，它从客户端库中获取样本，并将它们暴露给非prometheus监控系统。例如，Python、Go和Java客户端可以将度量导出到Graphite。)||
|Client library|A client library is a library in some language (e.g. Go, Java, Python, Ruby) that makes it easy to directly instrument your code, write custom collectors to pull metrics from other systems and expose the metrics to Prometheus.(客户端库是用某种语言(例如Go、Java、Python、Ruby)编写的库，它可以轻松地直接检测您的代码，编写自定义收集器从其他系统提取指标并将指标暴露给Prometheus。)||
|Collector|A collector is a part of an exporter that represents a set of metrics.  It may be a single metric if it is part of direct instrumentation, or many metrics if it is pulling metrics from another system.(收集器是表示一组指标的导出器的一部分。如果它是直接检测的一部分，它可能是单个度量，如果它是从另一个系统提取度量，它可能是多个度量。)|即 exporter可能包含多个collector,每个collector收集一个维度的数据|
|Direct instrumentation|Direct instrumentation is instrumentation added inline as part of the source code of a program, using a client library.(Direct instrumentation是使用客户端库作为程序源代码的一部分内联添加的插入。)||
|Endpoint|A source of metrics that can be scraped, usually corresponding to a single process.(可以抽取的度量标准的来源，通常对应于单个流程。)||
|Exporter|An exporter is a binary running alongside the application you want to obtain metrics from. The exporter exposes Prometheus metrics, commonly by converting metrics that are exposed in a non-Prometheus format into a format that Prometheus supports.(导出器是与您希望从中获得指标的应用程序一起运行的二进制文件。导出器公开普罗米修斯指标，通常是将以非普罗米修斯格式公开的指标转换为普罗米修斯支持的格式。)||
|Instance|An instance is a label that uniquely identifies a target in a job.||
|Job|A collection of targets with the same purpose, for example monitoring a group of like processes replicated for scalability or reliability, is called a job.(具有相同目的的目标集合(例如监视一组复制用于可伸缩性或可靠性的类似进程)称为作业。)||
|Notification|A notification represents a group of one or more alerts, and is sent by the Alertmanager to email, Pagerduty, Slack etc.(通知代表一组一个或多个警报，由Alertmanager发送到电子邮件、Pagerduty、Slack等。)||
|Promdash|Promdash was a native dashboard builder for Prometheus. It has been deprecated and replaced by Grafana.||
|Prometheus|Prometheus usually refers to the core binary of the Prometheus system. It may also refer to the Prometheus monitoring system as a whole.(Prometheus 一般指Prometheus System的二进制文件，也可以指Prometheus一整个监控系统)||
|PromQL|PromQL is the Prometheus Query Language. It allows for a wide range of operations including aggregation, slicing and dicing, prediction and joins.(PromQL是Prometheus查询语言。它允许广泛的操作，包括聚合、切片和切块、预测和连接)||
|Pushgateway|The Pushgateway persists the most recent push of metrics from batch jobs. This allows Prometheus to scrape their metrics after they have terminated.(Pushgateway保存批处理作业中最新的指标推送。这允许普罗米修斯在它们终止后抓取它们的参数。)||
|Recording Rules|Recording rules precompute frequently needed or computationally expensive expressions and save their results as a new set of time series.(记录规则预先计算经常需要或计算量大的表达式，并将其结果保存为一组新的时间序列。)|批量数据处理?|
|Remote Read|Remote read is a Prometheus feature that allows transparent reading of time series from other systems (such as long term storage) as part of queries.(远程读取是Prometheus的一个特性，它允许从其他系统(如长期存储)透明地读取时间序列作为查询的一部分。)||
|Remote Read Adapter|Not all systems directly support remote read. A remote read adapter sits between Prometheus and another system, converting time series requests and responses between them.(并非所有系统都直接支持远程读取。远程读取适配器位于普罗米修斯和另一个系统之间，在它们之间转换时间序列请求和响应。)||
|Remote Read Endpoint|A remote read endpoint is what Prometheus talks to when doing a remote read.(远程读取端点是普罗米修斯在执行远程读取时与之通信的对象。)||
|Remote Write|Remote write is a Prometheus feature that allows sending ingested samples on the fly to other systems, such as long term storage.(远程写入是普罗米修斯的一个特性，它允许动态地将摄取的样本发送到其他系统，比如长期存储。)||
|Remote Write Adapter|Not all systems directly support remote write. A remote write adapter sits between Prometheus and another system, converting the samples in the remote write into a format the other system can understand.(并非所有系统都直接支持远程写入。远程写适配器位于普罗米修斯和另一个系统之间，将远程写中的示例转换为另一个系统可以理解的格式。)||
|Remote Write Endpoint|A remote write endpoint is what Prometheus talks to when doing a remote write.(远程写入端点是普罗米修斯在执行远程写入时与之通信的对象。)||
|Sample|A sample is a single value at a point in time in a time series.(样本是时间序列中某个时间点上的单个值。) In Prometheus, each sample consists of a float64 value and a millisecond-precision timestamp.(在Prometheus中，每个样本由一个float64值和一个毫秒级精度的时间戳组成。)||
|Silence|A silence in the Alertmanager prevents alerts, with labels matching the silence, from being included in notifications.(Alertmanager中的静默可以防止将带有与静默匹配标签的警报包含在通知中。)||
|Target|A target is the definition of an object to scrape. For example, what labels to apply, any authentication required to connect, or other information that defines how the scrape will occur.(目标是要提取的对象的定义。例如，要应用什么标签、连接所需的任何身份验证，或者定义提取如何发生的其他信息。)||
|Time Series|The Prometheus time series are streams of timestamped values belonging to the same metric and the same set of labeled dimensions. Prometheus stores all data as time series.（Prometheus时间序列是属于相同度量和相同标记维度集的时间戳值流。普罗米修斯将所有数据存储为时间序列。）||
